    "### Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Greedy Algorithm** is a problem-solving approach that makes a series of choices, each of which looks the best at the moment. The algorithm follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "1. **Local Optimality:** At each step, the algorithm makes a choice that seems the best at that moment.\n",
    "2. **Irrevocable Decisions:** Once a choice is made, it cannot be undone.\n",
    "3. **Feasibility:** The choice must be feasible, meaning it must satisfy the problem's constraints.\n",
    "4. **Optimal Substructure:** The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and the solution to the problem can be constructed efficiently from the solutions to the subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Selection:** Choose the best option from the current state.\n",
    "2. **Feasibility Check:** Ensure the chosen option is feasible.\n",
    "3. **Solution Construction:** Add the chosen option to the solution.\n",
    "4. **Repeat:** Repeat the process until the entire problem is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Problems:\n",
    "1. **Activity Selection Problem:** Select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.\n",
    "2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem:** Maximize the total value in the knapsack by taking fractions of items.\n",
    "3. **Huffman Coding:** Construct an optimal prefix code for a set of characters based on their frequencies.\n",

    "### TimSort\n",
    "\n",
    "**TimSort** is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. It is designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented in Python's built-in `sort()` method and Java's `Arrays.sort()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features:**\n",
    "  - **Hybrid Approach:** Combines the best parts of merge sort and insertion sort.\n",
    "  - **Stability:** Maintains the relative order of equal elements.\n",
    "  - **Adaptive:** Efficiently handles partially ordered arrays.\n",
    "  - **Divide and Conquer:** Divides the array into small segments (runs) and sorts them using insertion sort, then merges the runs using merge sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1. **Divide the Array:** Split the array into small segments called runs.\n",
    "  2. **Sort the Runs:** Use insertion sort to sort each run.\n",
    "  3. **Merge the Runs:** Use merge sort to merge the sorted runs into a single sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpolation Search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpolation Search** is an algorithm for searching for a given key in a sorted array. It is an improvement over binary search for instances where the values in the array are uniformly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features:**\n",
    "  - **Efficient for Uniformly Distributed Data:** Performs better than binary search when the data is uniformly distributed.\n",
    "  - **Dynamic Probing:** Uses the value of the key to estimate the position of the key in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1. **Calculate the Position:** Estimate the position of the key using the formula:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     \\text{pos} = \\text{low} + \\left( \\frac{(\\text{high} - \\text{low})}{(\\text{arr[high]} - \\text{arr[low]})} \\times (\\text{x} - \\text{arr[low]}) \\right)\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "  2. **Compare and Adjust:** Compare the key with the value at the estimated position. If it matches, return the position. If the key is smaller, adjust the high index; if larger, adjust the low index.\n",
    "  3. **Repeat:** Repeat the process until the key is found or the search space is exhausted.\n",
